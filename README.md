# Logistic-Regression-From-Scratch
I have created a Logistic Regression Class with Sigmoid activation function that calculates Test and train error and accuracy and plots them as well. The Code also contains steps i used to preprocess the data to prepare it for model fit.
I have used the penguins data set and this code is trying to predict whether the given parameters for a penguin belongs to Pygoscelis adeliae class or not.
